2. Rise of LAN parties → **1990s, during the 16-bit/early PC multiplayer era**.

## Level 2 – Analytical Byte

I’ll pick **A: 3D graphics and FPS evolution**.

The emergence of 3D graphics let FPS games move from flat corridors to fully navigable 3D spaces, which made aiming, movement, and spatial awareness far more engaging and skill-based (think of the jump from Doom-style pseudo-3D to Quake-style true 3D). This shift also enabled verticality (jump pads, multi-level arenas, rocket jumps), more complex map design, and more expressive weapon behavior, which helped FPS become a premier competitive and spectacle genre. As GPUs and APIs like Direct3D/OpenGL matured, FPS games could support higher resolutions, smoother framerates, and online play at scale, turning them into flagship showcases for PC and console power.

## Level 3 – Design & Influence Deep Dive

### 1. Technological advancement

One major **technological advancement** is widespread **broadband internet and client–server networking** in consumer PCs and consoles. This made persistent online worlds like World of Warcraft feasible and allowed GTA-style 3D streaming worlds to be patched, updated, and eventually shared online at scale, instead of being limited to small, dial-up connections or purely offline play.

Another crucial piece on the tech side is **hardware-accelerated 3D graphics (GPUs)**, which allowed large streaming cities (GTA III) and fully 3D MMORPG worlds (WoW) to render in real time with acceptable performance for home users.

### 2. Community trend WoW capitalized on

World of Warcraft leveraged the existing **MMO and online guild/clan culture** that had been building in games like EverQuest, Ultima Online, and earlier online communities. It leaned into players’ desire for:

- Long-term characters and progression shared with friends  
- Organized guilds, raids, and scheduled group content  
- Social hubs (cities, chat, trade) where “being online” felt like hanging out, not just playing a match  

This trend toward games as **social spaces**, not just challenges, is exactly what WoW polished and mainstreamed.

### 3. New game idea: GTA x WoW

**Working title:** “City of Legends Online”  
**Core genre:** Online **Open-World Action RPG** (blend of GTA-style sandbox with MMO-style persistent world).

**Core pitch:**  
A persistent, shared modern metropolis where every player is a citizen with a long-term character, leveling path, and reputation in a living online city.

**Key features:**

- **Open-world freedom (GTA-style):**  
  - Seamless city with districts (financial, industrial, slums, nightlife).  
  - You can drive, steal, trade, or legally build a business; missions are obtainable from factions (gangs, corporations, law enforcement, street racers).

- **Online social structure (WoW-style):**  
  - Player “Crews” instead of guilds: gangs, biker clubs, corpo teams, hacker cells.  
  - Crew HQs that function like WoW guild halls, upgradeable and visible in the world.  
  - City events (police crackdowns, blackouts, festivals) tuned for large groups.

- **Progression & roles:**  
  - Class-like archetypes: Enforcer, Wheelman, Fixer, Hacker, Face.  
  - Skill trees for driving, shooting, stealth, hacking, and social manipulation.  
  - Reputation with city factions changes what content, missions, and safe zones you get.

- **New player experience it offers:**  
  - The fantasy of living in a shared crime-infused metropolis where your **social ties** and **reputation** matter as much as your mechanical skill.  
  - Instead of isolated single-player chaos or short PvP matches, players experience **ongoing turf control**, negotiated alliances, scheduled heists (like raids), and social downtime in clubs, bars, and safehouses.  
  - Your character’s story is co-authored with others: crews pull off multi-stage heists (raid-style), then hang out in the city showing off vehicles, outfits, and territory, making the city feel like an MMO “capital city” everywhere, not just in one hub.
