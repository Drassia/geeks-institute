Gameplay Controls:
You have forward/backward right/left to control the horse. (there will be a slight random movement influence on the horse movement to the left or right to incentivize the player to go left or right to neutralize this random movement, the player horizontal -left/right- movements will influence the sorba AI agent movements, so we can have an opportunity to see horse clash within the sorba thus having a penalties).
