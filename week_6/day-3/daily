1️⃣ Communication Audit
Designer submitted a feature without informing developers

Why it’s a problem: Developers were unaware of the change, which caused a bug and disrupted the sprint plan.
​

Immediate improvement: Require that any new feature or change goes through a short announcement in a shared channel and is added as a task in the sprint board before implementation.
​

No clear process for announcing changes

Why it’s a problem: The team relies on informal communication, so important changes slip through and impact stability and deadlines.
​

Immediate improvement: Define a simple “change policy”: any new feature must be documented (one paragraph + impact) and reviewed quickly by at least one developer before being merged.
​

Team members avoid giving feedback

Why it’s a problem: Issues stay hidden, frustration grows, and bugs or workflow problems repeat because they are never openly discussed.
​

Immediate improvement: Schedule a short, regular feedback slot (e.g., 15 minutes at end of sprint day) using a structured format, and set a rule that feedback focuses on work, not people.
​

2️⃣ Feedback Exercise (Observation → Impact → Suggestion)
Constructive feedback to the designer:

Observation: “In today’s sprint, the new feature was added directly to the build without a prior message or task on the board, and it introduced a bug during testing.”

Impact: “This created unexpected work for the developers, increased stress close to the deadline, and slowed the team down because we had to stop and fix it.”

Suggestion: “For future features, could you first create a ticket, share a short note in the dev channel, and wait for a quick confirmation before integrating it into the main build?”

This keeps the tone professional, targets the behavior, and proposes a clear next step.
​

3️⃣ Stress & Collaboration Solution
Main stress factor for the developer

The main stress factor is overlapping tasks and tight deadlines, made worse by unexpected changes like unannounced features.
​

Two practical strategies to reduce stress and maintain collaboration

Strategy 1: Clarify priorities and workload at the start of each day (or sprint), so the developer has a realistic task list and can push back on extra work that doesn’t fit.

Strategy 2: Introduce a “no surprise changes” rule near deadlines, where new features must be scheduled for the next sprint unless the whole team agrees and adjusts scope.

One action for the team leader to prevent similar issues

The team leader can establish and enforce a simple workflow: all new features must be logged on the board, briefly discussed in daily standup, and approved before implementation, with a reminder that this process protects both quality and the team’s stress levels.
