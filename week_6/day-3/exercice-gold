Exercise 1 – Advanced Communication & Role Strategy

1. Team map, roles, and dependencies (example)
Role	        : Example responsibilities	Dependencies
Producer/ PM	: Planning, scope, priorities, risk, communication cadence	Needs input from all disciplines
Lead Designer	: Vision, core mechanics, feature priorities	Depends on tech feasibility, art capacity
Gameplay Developer  : Implement mechanics, fix bugs, profiling	Needs clear specs from design, assets from art
Tools / Tech Developer	: Engine/tools maintenance, build pipeline, performance	Depends on producer for priorities
Lead Artist	      : Art direction, key assets, pipeline	Needs design references, tech constraints
UI/UX Designer	  : Menus, HUD, flows, usability tests	Needs gameplay loops, implementation support
QA Lead / Tester  : Test plans, regression tests, bug reports	Needs builds from devs, decisions from leads
Mention overlapping roles (e.g., a developer also acting as build engineer, a designer also doing basic UI) and note risks such as overloading or decision bottlenecks.
​

2. Bottlenecks and breakdowns (examples)
All decisions waiting on one lead (producer or lead designer), causing delays.

Specs changing in chat only, so developers miss decisions.

Art and dev working on different versions of features due to outdated documentation.
​

3. Multi-layered communication system
Daily updates:

15-minute daily standup (synchronous): yesterday, today, blockers.

Asynchronous daily written update in a “#daily” channel for absent members.

Weekly alignment:

60–90 min weekly sprint meeting: review build, adjust priorities, confirm scope.

Separate short leads sync (producer + discipline leads) to align before team meeting.

Documentation and decision logging:

One source of truth (Notion/Confluence/Google Docs).

Each major decision logged with: date, owner, rationale, impact.
​

4. Risk mitigation plan for communication failures
Define escalation paths: if blocked >24 hours, escalate to producer, then to leadership.

Redundancy: at least two people understand each critical system or feature.

“Decision freeze” windows around milestones to avoid last-minute, undocumented changes.

Retrospectives after each milestone to review communication failures and define 1–2 concrete improvements.


Exercise 2 – Expert Feedback System & Iterative Improvement
1. Tiered feedback framework
Peer-to-peer:

Informal but structured: use Observation → Impact → Suggestion.

Done during feature handoffs and code/art reviews.

Lead-to-team:

Regular review sessions (e.g., weekly build review).

Focus on alignment with vision, quality bar, and priorities.

Cross-discipline review:

Dedicated playtest where designers, devs, artists, and QA watch and comment.

Emphasis on trade-offs (performance vs visuals vs UX).
​

2. Concrete feedback examples
Gameplay mechanic example:

Observation: “In the boss fight, the boss’s attack pattern repeats with no variation after 30 seconds.”

Impact: “Players quickly learn the pattern and the fight becomes repetitive instead of tense.”

Suggestion: “Introduce a second phase at 50% health with new attacks and a telegraphed pattern shift.”

Technical implementation example:

Observation: “Loading times spike from 2s to 8s when entering Level 3.”

Impact: “This breaks pacing and risks crashes on lower-spec machines.”

Suggestion: “Profile asset loading, stream large textures, and add a lightweight loading screen with tips.”
​

3. Tracking system for feedback
Use a board (Jira/Trello/ClickUp):

Columns: Backlog → To Review → In Progress → In Build → Verified.

Each feedback item is a ticket with type (gameplay, tech, art), owner, priority, due date.

Link feedback tickets to builds:

Note build number where the change is integrated.

QA verifies and closes items only after test in that build.
​

4. Turning negative reactions into productive outcomes
Normalize emotional response: acknowledge frustration first, then shift to problem-solving.

Use facilitation phrases: “What problem are we trying to solve?”, “What constraints are we working with?”

Reframe blame into hypotheses: “What might be causing this issue?” instead of “Who messed this up?”

Add a rule: no feedback during crunch without a proposed next step (even if it’s “park and revisit after deadline”).


Exercise 3 – Stress Management, Conflict Resolution & Leadership
1. Four major stress factors and strategies
Technical stress (e.g., engine bugs, crashes):

Strategy 1: Time-box technical spikes, then decide to fix, work around, or cut.

Strategy 2: Maintain a risk register with top tech risks and mitigation owners.

Strategy 3: Pair programming or problem-solving sessions for critical issues.
​

Deadline stress:

Strategy 1: Aggressive scope control; define “must-have / nice-to-have / cut” lists.

Strategy 2: Milestone slicing – frequent small milestones rather than one big delivery.

Strategy 3: Transparent progress dashboards so surprises are minimized.
​

Interpersonal stress:

Strategy 1: Regular 1:1s between leads and team members to surface tension early.

Strategy 2: Shared team agreements on communication tone, feedback rules, and meeting etiquette.

Strategy 3: Rotate “meeting facilitator” to ensure everyone is heard.
​

Personal stress (individual capacity, life events):

Strategy 1: Encourage people to flag overload early; adjust tasks accordingly.

Strategy 2: Respect no-meeting or focus blocks, especially near deadlines.

Strategy 3: Provide flexibility (remote work hours, short breaks) where possible.
​

2. Critical conflict scenario and resolution
Example scenario: Lead designer insists on keeping a complex feature, while lead developer argues it will jeopardize stability and deadline.

Conflict type:

Task and process conflict, with a risk of becoming personal if unmanaged.

Step-by-step resolution:

Frame the shared goal (shippable, high-impact prototype by date X).

Each lead states their view, constraints, and risks without interruption.

List options: full feature, reduced version, delayed version, or cut.

Evaluate options against impact vs cost vs risk; use simple scoring if needed.

Decide as a small group (producer + both leads) and document the decision.

Communicate rationale to the team and schedule a follow-up review after the milestone.
​

3. Leadership approach and prevention
Leadership style:

Calm, data-informed, and transparent, highlight trade-offs instead of imposing decisions without context.

Protect the team from scope creep and unrealistic demands.

Preventive measures:

Clear decision-making authority (“who decides what”).

Early risk discussions whenever scope changes are proposed.

Regular retrospectives focusing on “what to change next time” rather than blame.
​

4. Sustaining collaboration during crunch with minimal burnout
Limit consecutive crunch days; set maximum overtime and enforce recovery days.

Focus sprints: during crunch, each person has a narrow set of tasks, fewer meetings, and high support.

Celebrate small wins (build milestones, resolved bugs) and publicly recognize collaborative behavior.

After crunch, run a structured debrief to capture lessons and adjust processes so crunch is rarer and more controlled.
