Exercise 1 – Communication & Role Clarity
Roles and responsibilities (example table)

Role	    : Main responsibilities
Producer	: Define milestones, prioritize tasks, track progress, remove     blockers, coordinate team
Designer	: Define core mechanics, write design docs, tune game balance, prepare prototype specs
Developer	: Implement features, fix bugs, integrate assets, maintain build stability
Artist	    : Create UI, characters, environments, and VFX; prepare assets for integration

QA / Tester	Test builds, report bugs clearly, verify fixes, track regressions
Communication channels
Chat: Quick questions, daily coordination, sharing small updates.

Weekly meeting (video or in-person): Review progress, adjust priorities, resolve blockers.

Email: Formal decisions, recap of key decisions and milestones.

Documentation (Notion / Google Docs): Design docs, task board, meeting notes.

Communication plan (example)
Daily:

10–15 min standup on chat or call: what was done yesterday, today’s plan, blockers.

Producer posts a brief end-of-day summary in chat.

Weekly:

1 planning/review meeting to:

Review last week’s progress.

Decide priorities for next sprint.

Clarify responsibilities for new tasks.

Framework: Observation → Impact → Suggestion
Example definition:

Observation: What you saw/heard in the prototype, concrete and neutral.

Impact: How it affects player experience, production, or goals.

Suggestion: A clear, actionable idea to improve it.

Example of constructive feedback
Observation: “In the second level, enemies spawn directly behind the player without warning.”

Impact: “This feels unfair and makes players lose health in ways they can’t anticipate, which may cause frustration.”

Suggestion: “Add a short audio cue or spawn indicator behind the player 1–2 seconds before enemies appear.”

How feedback is received and applied
After each playtest, the team meets for 30 minutes.

Everyone notes feedback in a shared doc using the Observation → Impact → Suggestion format.

Producer and designer:

Group feedback by theme (controls, UX, difficulty).

Prioritize items into “do now”, “do later”, “parked”.

Developer and artist:

Turn prioritized feedback into tasks on the board (e.g., Trello/Jira).

Mark each item as implemented and link to the build where it was fixed.

Preventing feedback from becoming personal
Focus on the work, not the person (“This mechanic feels confusing” vs. “You did this wrong”).

Use “I” statements: “I found it hard to understand where to go” instead of “Players will be lost.”

Set rules for feedback sessions:

No interruptions, active listening.

Assume positive intent.

Time-box discussions; if it becomes heated, park it and revisit calmly.

Encourage team members to ask clarifying questions before defending their choices.



Three main sources of stress (example) and solutions
Tight deadline for playable prototype

Solution 1: Break work into smaller milestones with mini-deadlines and visible progress.

Solution 2: Reduce scope (cut non-essential features) while protecting the core experience.

Unclear priorities and task ownership

Solution 1: Producer maintains a visible task board with owners and due dates.

Solution 2: Weekly re-prioritization meeting to clarify what is “must have” vs “nice to have.”

Communication overload or silence

Solution 1: Agree on when to use which channel (chat vs meeting vs doc).

Solution 2: Schedule a short weekly “health check” where everyone can share concerns safely.

Conflict scenario (example)
Scenario: Designer wants to add a complex new feature to improve innovation, but developer worries it will risk the deadline.

Conflict type
Mainly task-based and process-based (what to build now and how to plan it).

Steps to resolve it
Clarify the shared goal: deliver a stable, fun prototype by the deadline.

Each side explains their perspective in turn (no interruptions).

List constraints: time, skills, tech limitations, testing needs.

Explore options:

Implement a simplified version of the feature.

Move full version to “post-prototype” phase.

Create a small spike/proof-of-concept time-boxed to 1 day.

Decide together which option best supports the goal and document the decision.

Review after a week: did the decision help both quality and schedule?

Leadership behavior
Stay neutral and calm, let both sides speak.

Reframe discussion around the team’s goals, not individual preferences.

Protect people from burnout (no constant overtime, encourage breaks).

Recognize good collaboration publicly, not just delivered features.
